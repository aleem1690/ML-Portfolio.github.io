# Password Strength Prediction

The Password Strength Prediction project aims to predict the strength of passwords based on various features using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a multiclass logistic regression model on TF-IDF representations of password text.

## Features

The main features of the Password Strength Prediction project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values in the dataset by removing the corresponding rows or imputing the missing values using appropriate techniques. Data cleaning and preprocessing may also involve removing duplicate passwords or handling special characters.

2. Feature Engineering: Create a function, `word_char`, to split each password into a list of letters. This function is used as a tokenizer in the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) transformation process. Feature engineering involves transforming raw password data into numerical representations that can be used for modeling.

3. TF-IDF Transformation: Apply the TF-IDF transformation to convert the password text into numerical representations. TF-IDF assigns weights to each word or character based on its frequency in the password and its rarity in the overall dataset. This step captures the importance of each word or character in predicting the password strength.

4. Multiclass Logistic Regression: Build a multiclass logistic regression model to predict the strength of passwords. Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm that can handle multiple classes. It learns the relationship between the password features and the corresponding strength labels, allowing for the prediction of password strength based on new input data.

## Usage

To use the Password Strength Prediction project:

1. Dataset: Prepare a dataset containing password text and corresponding strength labels. The strength labels can be categorized into different classes, such as "weak," "medium," and "strong," based on predefined criteria.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values by either removing the corresponding rows or applying appropriate imputation techniques. Clean the data by removing duplicates or handling special characters, depending on the specific requirements of the project.

3. Feature Engineering: Implement the `word_char` function to split each password into a list of letters. This function can be customized based on the specific requirements of the project.

4. TF-IDF Transformation: Apply the TF-IDF transformation to convert the password text into numerical representations. This can be done using libraries such as scikit-learn, which provide functions for TF-IDF vectorization.

5. Model Training: Build a multiclass logistic regression model using the TF-IDF transformed data and the corresponding strength labels. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the multiclass logistic regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Assess the model's ability to predict the strength labels accurately based on the input password features.

7. Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen password data. Use the trained model to classify the strength of passwords based on their features.
