# Churn Analysis

The Churn Analysis project aims to predict customer churn based on various features using machine learning techniques. The project
involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a logistic regression model.

## Features

The main features of the Churn Analysis project include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values in the dataset. In this project, the credit score column is dropped due to having more
than 30% missing values. For the "rewards earned" column, missing values are replaced with the median value. This step ensures that 
the dataset is clean and suitable for modeling.

2. Feature Engineering: Perform feature engineering tasks such as scaling or encoding categorical variables, creating new features from 
existing ones, or selecting relevant features. Feature engineering helps in improving the performance of the model by capturing
meaningful patterns and relationships in the data.

3. Standardization: Use the Standard Scaler method to standardize the numerical features in the dataset. Standardization brings the 
features to a similar scale, which is particularly important when using algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input data. 
This step helps in reducing the impact of features with larger values dominating the model.

4. Logistic Regression Model: Build a logistic regression model to predict customer churn. Logistic regression is a popular 
classification algorithm that is suitable for binary classification problems such as churn prediction. It learns the relationship 
between the input features and the target variable, allowing for the prediction of customer churn based on the available data.

## Usage

To use the Churn Analysis project:

1. Dataset: Prepare a dataset containing customer data, including features that can potentially influence churn, such as demographic 
information, transaction history, or customer behavior. Ensure that the dataset includes the target variable indicating whether a 
customer has churned or not.

2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values in the dataset by either dropping columns with a high percentage of missing values or 
applying suitable imputation techniques. Clean the data to remove duplicates or handle outliers, depending on the specific requirements
of the project.

3. Feature Engineering: Perform feature engineering tasks such as scaling numerical features or encoding categorical variables.
Create new features from existing ones, if necessary, to capture additional information that may be relevant for churn prediction.

4. Standardization: Standardize the numerical features in the dataset using techniques such as the Standard Scaler. This ensures that 
all features are on a similar scale, reducing the impact of features with larger values dominating the model.

5. Model Training: Build a logistic regression model using the preprocessed dataset. Split the dataset into training and testing sets 
to evaluate the model's performance.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1 score. Assess the model's ability to predict customer churn based on the available data.

7. Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen customer data. Use 
the trained model to classify whether a customer is likely to churn based on their features.
