# User Premium Purchase Prediction

The User Premium Purchase Prediction project aims to predict whether a user will make a premium purchase based on their app history data. The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a logistic regression model.

## Features

The main features of the User Premium Purchase Prediction project include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset, understand the distribution of variables, identify patterns, and check for correlations between variables. EDA helps in understanding the data and identifying potential relationships that can be leveraged for prediction.

2. Null Values Handling: Remove or impute null values in the dataset. Null values can affect the quality of predictions if not properly handled. Removing or imputing these values ensures that the dataset is clean and suitable for modeling.

3. Feature Engineering: Use the "top_screens" file to replace the "screen_list" column, which contains a list of screens viewed by the user. This step helps in transforming the categorical variable into a numerical representation that can be used for modeling. Consider using one-hot encoding to represent the screens as binary variables.

4. Standardization: Standardize the numerical features using techniques such as the Standard Scaler. Standardization brings the features to a similar scale, which is particularly important when using algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input data. This step helps in reducing the impact of features with larger values dominating the model.

5. Logistic Regression Model: Build a logistic regression model to predict whether a user will make a premium purchase. Logistic regression is a popular classification algorithm that is suitable for binary classification problems. It learns the relationship between the input features and the target variable, enabling the prediction of the likelihood of a premium purchase based on user app history data.

## Usage

To use the User Premium Purchase Prediction project:

1. Dataset: Prepare a dataset containing user app history data, including features such as user interactions, screens viewed, and any other relevant information. Ensure that the dataset includes the target variable indicating whether the user made a premium purchase.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform EDA on the dataset to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlations, and gain insights into the data. Visualize the data using plots and perform statistical analysis to uncover patterns or relationships that can be leveraged for prediction.

3. Null Values Handling: Remove or impute null values in the dataset. Null values can be removed by deleting the corresponding rows or imputed by filling them with suitable values based on the specific context and dataset requirements.

4. Feature Engineering: Use the "top_screens" file to replace the "screen_list" column. This step involves transforming the categorical variable into a numerical representation that can be used for modeling. Consider using one-hot encoding to represent the screens as binary variables.

5. Standardization: Standardize the numerical features using techniques such as the Standard Scaler. This ensures that all features are on a similar scale, reducing the impact of features with larger values dominating the model.

6. Model Training: Build a logistic regression model using the preprocessed dataset. Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the logistic regression model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Assess the model's ability to predict whether a user will make a premium purchase based on their app history data.

8. Model Deployment: Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed to make predictions on new, unseen app history data. Use the trained model to classify whether a user is likely to make a premium purchase based on their features.
