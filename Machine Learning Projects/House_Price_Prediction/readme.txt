# House Price Prediction

The House Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of houses based on various features using ensemble learning techniques. 
The project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, and building an ensemble model comprising 
linear regression, random forest, decision tree, SVR, and XGBoost algorithms.

## Features

The main features of the House Price Prediction project include:

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, correlations, and outliers. 
Visualize the data using plots and statistical analysis.

2. Outlier Removal: Identify and remove extreme outliers that could adversely affect the performance of the predictive models. 
Outliers can skew the predictions and introduce noise into the training process.

3. Missing Values Handling: Remove or impute missing values in the dataset. Missing values can affect the quality of the predictions 
and introduce biases if not properly handled.

4. Standardization: Standardize the numerical features to ensure that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. 
Standardization is important when the features have different scales or units, as it brings them to a similar scale 
and prevents dominance by features with larger values.

5. Ensemble Learning: Create an ensemble model by combining predictions from multiple algorithms, including linear regression, 
random forest, decision tree, SVR, and XGBoost. Ensemble learning helps to improve the overall predictive performance by leveraging 
the strengths of individual algorithms.

6. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the ensemble model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error(MAE),
mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared. Compare the performance of the ensemble model with individual algorithms to determine the 
best-performing approach.

7. Model Selection: Select the best-performing model from the ensemble based on the evaluation metrics. In this project, XGBoost was 
found to have the lowest MAE value, indicating its superior predictive performance compared to other algorithms.

## Usage

To use the House Price Prediction project:

1. Dataset: Prepare a dataset containing house features and corresponding target variable (house price).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Perform EDA on the dataset to understand the distribution of features, identify correlations, 
and detect outliers. Visualize the data using plots and statistical analysis.

3. Outlier Removal: Identify and remove extreme outliers that could affect the predictive models' performance. Outliers can be 
removed based on statistical methods or domain knowledge.

4. Missing Values Handling: Handle missing values in the dataset by removing the corresponding rows, imputing the missing values with 
appropriate techniques, or using advanced imputation methods.

5. Standardization: Standardize the numerical features using techniques such as the Standard Scaler. This step ensures that all features 
are on a similar scale and prevents dominance by features with larger values.

6. Ensemble Learning: Create an ensemble model by combining predictions from different algorithms, such as linear regression, 
random forest, decision tree, SVR, and XGBoost. Consider using techniques like stacking, blending, or voting to combine the 
individual models' predictions.

7. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the ensemble model's performance using suitable evaluation metrics such as MAE and MSE. 
Compare the performance of the ensemble model with individual algorithms to identify the best-performing approach.

8. Model Selection: Select the best-performing model from the ensemble based on the evaluation metrics. In this project, XGBoost was 
found to have the lowest MAE value, indicating its superior predictive performance compared to other algorithms.
